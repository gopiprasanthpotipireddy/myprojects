sufficiently to determine the feasibility and usability of a finished
system.  The core concept is to track the no of items from the
department with additional features for interpreting the data.  It
uses a client-server model with a connected database to allow
multiple departments and databases to be connected.  This allows for
later expansion while still supporting the targeted small businesses.</font></p>

is a real-time inventory database capable of connecting multiple
departments.  This can be used to track the inventory of a single
department, or to manage the distribution of stock between several
branches of a larger college or university.  However, the system
merely records sales and restocking data and provides notification of
low stock at any location through email at a specified interval.  The
goal is to reduce the strain of tracking rather than to handle all
store maintenance.  Further features may include the ability to
generate reports of sales, but again the interpretation is left to
the management.  In addition, since theft does occasionally occur,
the system provides solutions for confirming the store inventory and
for correcting stock quantities.</font></p>

uses a web-based interface to display inventory data to the stock
manager client.  The product will use of open-source software
primarily due to cost of implementation.  A PHP servlet will be
hosted by a Wamp web server (on top of any choice of operating
system, although a flavor of Unix is recommend).  The first feature
of the Stock Manager Client web interface component allows the Stock
Manager Client to view the current stock of products, along with the
capabilities of searching and sorting the products.  The second
feature of the Stock Manager Client web interface will allow the user
to modify application settings, such as the threshold for email
notifications, frequency of inventory scans (daily at a particular
hour, weekly, monthly, etc.), and security settings.  The third
feature of the Stock Manager Client web interface will allow the user
to update the inventory during the restocking process.  Since a web
interface will be used, a network that supports the HTTP/HTTPS
protocol must exist, whether it is a private network for an isolated
customer deployment or an Internet connection for a multi-site
customer deployment.  The bandwidth of the network depends on the
frequency of transactions.  A bandwidth of at least 10 Mbps is
recommended (small commercial deployment).  The database to store the
inventory data will use a MySQL database.</font></p>

the software and hardware resources of cash registers are not
available due to the variation in software and cost, we will be
developing an emulated Register client to interface with actual cash
registers.  The Cash Register client will emulate purchases by having
a simple graphical interface with fields for a quantity and a button
to make a purchase. As these resources become available, the actual
implementation for specific cash register models will be considered
for future releases of the </font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><i>Stock

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm; line-height: 115%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">	Alternatively,
commercially licensed products are available.  In particular, the
Microsoft ASP.NET (Active Server Pages) framework can be used.  This
requires a Microsoft ASP.NET web server and a Microsoft SQL Server
database, which also requires a Microsoft operating system.  However,
these alternative system requirements will increase the overall costs
for both implementation and deployment.</font></p>
